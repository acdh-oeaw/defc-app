Importing vocabularies in db: 

All vocabularies are stored in csv files in format {classname}, {fieldname_01}, {fieldvalue_01}, {fieldname_02}, {value_02}

1. Run python manage.py shell_plus --notebook --settings=orea.settings.yoursettingsfile.py

2. run import_nofk_vocabs.ipynb (processing csv with simple vocabs, no FK, no ManyToMany)

3. run import_regions_districts.ipynb (vocabs with FK)

4. run pottery_import.ipynb (vocabs with ManyToMany)

5. run chronology_import.ipynb (vocabs with ManyToMany)

6. Check if all the values were imported: the final print number ('saved { number } entries') should be equal to the number of values in a vocabulary
