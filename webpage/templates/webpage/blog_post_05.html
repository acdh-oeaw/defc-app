                <p>
                    Archaeological chronology is a complex and sometimes messy system of archaeological periods that enables archaeologists to determine the phase of a culture within a time sequence. The main definition of an archaeological period is not based on an absolute time-span but rather on distinctive characteristics of past human activities. For example, the Neolithic period is characterized by the occurrence of pottery and farming. Because the knowledge (and people) was spreading slowly, it often occurred that one region just started to learn about it, while another region was already characterized by what we call the Bronze Age. An archaeological period can, therefore, be present at different times in different places. However, not all regions followed the same period sequence. For example, while in some regions a direct transition from Neolithic to the Bronze Age has been confirmed, in other regions Neolithic was first followed by Chalcolithic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the general periods, archaeologists also use more detailed periods or phases to describe particulars of one material culture. Because each material culture is bound to a specific region during a specific time-span, the same goes for such archaeological periods. They are often named after prominent archaeological sites where the distinctive artefacts were found (e.g. Argissa I in Thessaly, Greece). Such archaeological periods/phases may overlap in time, but they are region specific. Furthermore, because several researchers worked on the same material culture, many developed their own chronological system. The result is many archaeological periods/phases describing the same material culture within the same region, but with a bit different sequencing of sub-phases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking all this into account it becomes obvious that structuring and formalizing archaeological chronology is a challenging task. <a href="{% url 'webpage:chronology-table' %}">The chronology of the DEFC app</a> is an attempt to provide an overview of archaeological periods used in Greece and Anatolia for the period of as early as 10000 (Anatolia) to ca. 2000 BC. To contribute to linked data and to ensure the possibility for their reuse, the periods of the app were linked to <a href="https://perio.do/en/">PeriodO</a> – the public domain gazetteer of scholarly definitions of historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Creating the DEFC chronology</h2>
                <p>DEFC chronology was created in collaboration with Anatolian Aegean Prehistoric Phenomena (AAPP) research group (OREA ÖAW) using existing literature and relying on the experience and knowledge of the research group members. The periods were gathered separately for the following regions covering periods from the Neolithic to Early Bronze Age:</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Linking to PeriodO</h2>
                <p>
                    PeriodO is an online gazetteer for historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods. Using PeriodO it is possible to define an archaeological period through an absolute time-span and the region of interest. As the final result, a permalink for each defined period is created, which can be used as a URI to link two or more online sources. All periods from the DEFC chronology were defined using PeriodO and then linked with the periods listed in the DEFC app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The periods from the DEFC chronology were grouped into three PeriodO collections. The so-called DEFC Project collection contains archaeological periods (i.e. the absolute time-span) that were derived but not literally copied from the cited literature. The other three collections (Schoop – Greiner 2005, Clare – Weiniger 2014, Tomkins 2007) include periods exactly as they were defined by the authors of cited works and as such also used in the DEFC chronology.
                </p>
                <h3>Collection permalinks:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://test.perio.do/#/p/Canonical/periodCollections/p0qv6m8/">DEFC collection</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://test.perio.do/#/p/Canonical/periodCollections/p053rvt/">Clare – Weninger 2017 </a></li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The collections can be reused by other projects investigating Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age in Greece and Anatolia.
