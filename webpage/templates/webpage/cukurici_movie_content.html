        The palaeogeographic reconstruction shows that the Neolithic settlement of Çukuriçi Höyük is situated in a fertile basin close to the seashore. Another Neolithic settlement, Arvalya Höyük, was detected in the western neighbouring valley.

      After a hiatus of more than 2500 years Çukuriçi Höyük was resettled in the Late Chalcolithic Period. The plan including the excavated remains and the results of the geophysical prospection show a settlement structure of free standing buildings.
